# Tetris in C++

This repository contains a simple tetris implementation using c++ and the `ncurses` library.

* This is still a work in progress, hopefully I have enough time to clean everything up.
* This is a small extension project based off this [Tetris tutorial](https://youtu.be/8OK8_tHeCIA) with the main difference that this uses the `ncurses` library instead of the `Windows` library.

## Prerequisites

* `ncurses` library
* This should work on both MacOS and Linux systems.


## Features to Add

- [ ] Hard-drop tetris piece with space bar
